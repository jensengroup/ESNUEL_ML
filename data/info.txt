Hydrolysis Rate Data and Activation Energy Values (Supporting Information for doi 10.1021/acs.est.6b05412)

This dataset consists of rate constants, half-lives and activation energy values for hydrolysis of organic chemicals compiled from journal publications and regulatory reports. The dataset was used to develop a ranked library of transformation reaction schemes for abiotic hydrolysis of organic chemicals under environmentally relevant conditions. The spreadsheet file HydrolysisRateConstants_est6b05412.xlsx contains a compilation of 187 literature-reported hydrolysis half-lives adjusted to pH 5, 7 and 9 and temperature of 25°C. The spreadsheet file HydrolysisActivationEnergy_est6b05412.xlsx contains a compilation of 58 literature-reported activation energies for hydrolysis reaction schemes.

This dataset is associated with the following publication: Stevens, C., J. Patel, J. Jones, and E. Weber. Prediction of Hydrolysis Products of Organic Chemicals under Environmental pH Conditions. ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY. American Chemical Society, Washington, DC, USA, 51(9): 5008–5016, (2017).

A Multiple Linear Regression Approach to the Estimation of Carboxylic Acid Ester and Lactone Alkaline Hydrolysis Rate Constants

The dataset contains identifying information (name, SMILES string), measured hydrolysis rate constants, and calculated molecular descriptors for 223 carboxylic acid esters and 108 lactones. The descriptors include pKa values, charge (and electronegativity), charge density (by Hückel analysis), and steric parameters (both topological and geometrical).

This dataset is associated with the following publication: Lazare, J., C. Stevens, and E. Weber. A multiple linear regression approach to the estimation of carboxylic acid ester and lactone alkaline hydrolysis rate constants. SAR AND QSAR IN ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH. Taylor & Francis, Inc., Philadelphia, PA, USA, 34(3): 183-210, (2023).
